# Find-Your-Way-Out----Text-Game

This is a text game i'm building for fun with c++ which requires the user to enter input in order to enter rooms, find items, do objectives, and eventually find your way out. 

Ending is complete. Still need to complete the hallway selection it that is the first input. 
staircase scenario still needs some touch up but gets you to the ending
open door on the left is still in the works.
