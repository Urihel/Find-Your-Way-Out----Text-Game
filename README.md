# Find-Your-Way-Out----Text-Game

This is a text game i'm building for fun with c++ which requires the user to enter input in order to enter rooms, find items, do objectives, and eventually find your way out. 

#notes
game ending is up. Just chose options until you get there. unfortunately, i still need to go back and make a hallway selection scenario and connect that back to mainHallway, the door on the left selection needs to be stated what is going to happen if we go there first.
